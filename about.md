My name is __Alexander Popov__, and this is my personal blog about OS kernel development and security: vulnerability discovery, exploitation techniques, and defensive technologies.

I'm a Linux kernel developer since 2012. I'm focused on kernel security.
<br />Here are [my contributions](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=Alexander+Popov) to the mainline kernel and [my conference talks](https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/conference_talks/).

Some of my open source projects:
<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;► [Linux Kernel Defence Map](https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/linux-kernel-defence-map), which shows the relationships between:
  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Vulnerability classes,
  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Exploitation techniques,
  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Bug detection mechanisms,
  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Defence technologies.
<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;► [kconfig-hardened-check](https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check) -- a tool for checking the security hardening options of the Linux kernel.
<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;► [kernel-hack-drill](https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill) -- a playground for the experiments with Linux kernel exploits.
<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;► [kernel-build-containers](https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-build-containers) -- a project providing containers for building software with different compilers for various architectures.

There are mirrors of these projects at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/a13xp0p0v) and [GitFlic](https://gitflic.ru/user/a13xp0p0v).

You can join the [LinKerSec](https://t.me/s/linkersec) Telegram channel about Linux kernel security, authored by me and [Andrey Konovalov](https://xairy.io/).
